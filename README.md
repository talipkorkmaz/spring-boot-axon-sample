# Spring Boot Axon Sample

## Introduction

This is a sample application to demonstrate Spring Boot (1.5.x) and Axon Framework (3.x).

The Todo application makes use of the following design patterns:
- Domain Driven Design
- CQRS
- Event Sourcing
- Task based User Interface

## Building

> mvn package

## Running

> mvn spring-boot:run

Browse to http://localhost:8080/index.html

## Access h2_console

- Username : sa
- Password : <empty>
- JDBC Url : jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
- Driver Class : org.h2.Driver

## Implementation

Implementation notes:
- The event store is backed by a JPA Event Store implementation which comes with Axon
- The query model is backed by a Spring Data JPA Repository
- The user interface is updated asynchronously via stompjs over websockets using Spring Websockets support

## Roadmap

- Add unit and integration tests
- Replace JPA EventStore with AxonDB
- Convert AngularJS to Angular, ReactJS or other
